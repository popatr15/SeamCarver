# SeamCarver

  This project takes in a picture and decreases the width of the picture without distorting it. The program does so by calculating a
map that denotes the change in pixels  based on the ones near by it. The program then choses a vertical seam that has the least change and removes that seam of pixels from the picture thereby shortening it.
